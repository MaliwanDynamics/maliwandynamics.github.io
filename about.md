What the heck is the point of this website?

Honestly, I do not know what the point is for sure yet. I trust the general direction will form on its own as time goes on.  

As for why, it's a bit selfish. I want some form of accountability structure to keep learning and trying new things. 

For a long time, I feared the creation of any online presence beyond the basic gmail and Linkedin resume. A really long time in fact.

The perks of being hyper introverted I guess!

I have tried a few times in the past, but chickened out after a few months of blogging. I would simply run out of steam and felt like it was pointless, that I could not improve.

So with this attempt, I refuse to get all weird and fancy by picking a niche or focusing on followers. The main goal is simply to continue learning and document it.

If anyone gets value out of it, that's dope.
